you can call me by the name Kuni, or Elli atleast. Firstly-for the DO NOT INTERACT rules, please don't interact if you're HOMOPHOBIC, someone who's against LGBTQ. please respect us and leave us be if you hate it and also a PROSHIPPER. DO NOT INTERACT SHIPS- Ichance, Shopdebt, Frozendebt, SecondChance, PizzaTime, Scaramona, Scaradottore, SleepyDeceit, ElderFaerie/Shadow Milk or anything that is considered ILLEGAL. Please respect my choices since these ships arent passed for my likings.

 Cuds are fine for me, but please not in the middle of me with my friends. it's a little too awkward. I am friendly, but the way i speak is not considerable. I don't talk alot, i'm not the one who would communicate to you like a yapper would.
 I'm a writer, I wrote "My lantern" Azuretime, you can see it in a Library game in roblox. I'm also an artist, but i rarely show some arts since i lost my style these days. I can also sing, but i don't sing for everyone just so easily. Call me with the pronouns THEY/THEM, Don't call me he/she unless i told you so. I don't know what to tell more, have a good day. thankyou for reading.

 ### if you wanna know a little about how i act, please consider reading chance 's respository.

 Ilysm and thankyou for mentioning me my dear, chancey
